## Hi, I am Mahesh ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Developer passionate about building innovative and scalable web applications. Although I have a Master's degree in Computer applications, my interests lie in web development, where I primarily work with **React**, **NodeJS**, and **TypeScript**.

I love building challenging projects and enjoy deep-diving into topics until I understand them completely.
